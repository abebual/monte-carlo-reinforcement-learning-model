In this project we developed a Monte-Carlo Reinforcment Learning Agent to play an optimal strategy to win a simplified scope of UNO Card Game. The project is stractured as follows:
1. Game Environment 
2. Monte-Carlo Reinforcment Learning Agent 
3. Model Training and Performance 
4. Experments 


### 1. Game Environment 
In environment.py class objects for <i>card, deck, player, turn</i> and <i>game</i> are defined. In main.ipynb, the classes are imported as module, to run simulations. The state_action_reward.py includes the <i>state, action, </i> and <i>reward</i> class objects. 

### 2. Monte-Carlo Reinforcment Learning Agent 
The monte-carlo method reinforcment learning algorithm is defined in agents.py module. 

### 3. Model Training and Performance 

### 4. Experments 

**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, random, itertools, time, tqdm, sys, os, matplotlib, seaborn, ipywidgets
