In this project we developed a Monte-Carlo Reinforcment Learning Agent to play an optimal strategy to win a simplified scope of UNO Card Game. The project is stractured as follows:
1. Game Environment 
2. Monte-Carlo Reinforcment Learning Agent 
3. Model Training and Performance 
4. Experments 


### 1. Game Environment
